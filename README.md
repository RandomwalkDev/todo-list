<!-- ## Problem Statement:
Your task is to create a TODO List, 
wait... its not a normal TODO list that you find in Youtube, The task is to build a TODO list that works for everyone, this includes:-
- people of all Ages (old age , small kids ) 
- people with various physical challenges (blindness, limited dexterity ,high eye-sight, color blindness)   
- people in all the instances (morning, night ,dnd time)
- people from all regions (language issue,...)
- many more...

Individuals with special needs face a variety of challenges, creating an open-ended assessment. You are encouraged to assume and include any features that would enhance the website's usability for all users. Please detail all the features and issues addressed in the **README of the repository**, as this will aid us in evaluating your submission. 

Our aim is to assess applicants' aptitude, innovative thinking, and their ability to empathize with and understand user needs.

- **If you are a frontend developer** : build only the frontend of the TODO list make it work with a local variable,applicants are free to explore any techstack (quick secret: live link would add value to the submission)
- **If you are a Fullstack developer**: build both the frontend and backend of the TODO list, applicants are free to explore any techstack (quick secret: live link would add value to the submission)
- **If you are a Designer** : Design the UI and create a document on all the Ui/ux principles used and upload the document with the design hyperlink enclosed in the document. applicants are free to use any application to build the wireframes
## **Deliverables**:
### Applicants for frontend role 
1) Github Repo containing code
2) Video recording of the website
3) Readme explaining the steps and features
4) live link of the website (optional)
### Applicants for fullstack role 
1) Github Repo containing both frontend and backend in single repo
2) Video recording of the website
3) Readme explaining the steps and features
4) live link of the website (optional)
### Applicants for designer role
1) document link explaining UI/UX principles used
2) wireframe (figma , framer ...)



**Push the source code along with a demo video of your solution into the forked github repo. Share the repo link in the google form: [https://forms.gle/2HbLP8GNiYArZFsj8](https://forms.gle/ufqFg2Kgk5C54Amn7)**

Designers can provide a link to the document outlining all the UI/UX principles used instead of a GitHub link. -->

## Installation

## Tech Stack
1. Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS , Redux Toolkit + React-Redux

2. Backend: Node.js, Express.js

3. Database: MongoDB

## Features

### 1. Task Management
- **a.** : Add, update, and delete tasks.
- **b.** : Mark tasks as completed.

### 2.Speech Accesibility

Individuals with special needs face a variety of challenges. So, inorder to incorporate this issue, I have added the access to add tasks to our Todo List by
Speech facility. We can speak the tasks and it will be added to our TODO List.

### 3.Dark Mode

Toggle between light and dark themes for a comfortable user experience in different environments. This also stands to be helpful for  people of all Ages (old age , small kids)
